# Combine Images with Canvas
Load and combine separate images into a single canvas element. 
This technique can provide a great deal of flexibility and customization 
options for images on a website. Combined with Javascript and CSS, the newly composed images 
can be dynamically scaled to fit within a responsive design. 

## Branches
This repository has branches for each step needed. 
You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the code at that stage. 
Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at.
