			<p>The area has beaches and balnearios which face both the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, and it has been a popular tourist destination since the 1970s.</p>
			<p>The province&rsquo;s 100-kilometre (62 mi) coastline tends to be mildly windy. The ocean waters are mainly shallows, with several natural marine pools in which visitors can bathe without danger. From north to south, the main beaches are Uvero Alto, Macao, Arena Gorda, B&aacute;varo, El Cortecito, Las Corales and Cabeza de Toro, all north of the cape; and Cabo Enga&ntilde;o, Punta Cana and Juanillo south of the cape.<p>
